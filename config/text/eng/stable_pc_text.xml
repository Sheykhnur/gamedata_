		<text>Lt. Priboi, before you start your work, you should know about this place. This is the road to the Zone. Further up North there's a broken bridge, but we've set up an outpost there too. Open areas are crawling with wild dogs, so it's not a safe place for wandering around. Oh, and a pack of mutants shows up every now and then. At 6:30 you should visit the trader, Sidorovich at the small village nearby. He will give you a bag with some papers. After that, you should visit the Bridge Outpost a few kilometers away from here, just follow the road, you can't miss it. There, you should talk to the Major.\n\nFurther up North beyond the army outpost is Garbage. Now there's a depressing place. So much contaminated shit in some spots, swimming would be easier than walking.\n\nDuring your job here, you will meet Bandits, Stalkers, The Duty, The Freedom, Monolith, Ecologists, and also the Mercenaries. The Stalkers and The Duty are our friends since last year, so you won't have problems with them. The Ecologists are a neutral scientist group, near lake Yantar. Well, the Bandits, Monoliths and Freedomers are our enemies. Be careful, this wont be an easy mission, soldier.\n\nGood luck,\nCaptain Vasilev</text>

		<text>As a result of the second Chernobyl disaster, The Zone is littered with small areas of altered physics, known as anomalies. There are several different variations, each one having a unique impact upon those who cross its path. Most anomalies produce visible air or light distortions and their extent can be determined by throwing bolts to trigger them. It's recommended to use an anomaly detector, which emits warning beeps of a varying frequency depending on their proximity to an anomaly.\n\nAnomalies produce artefacts, the valuable scientific curiosities that make the Zone worth exploring monetarily. As well as being traded for money, a number of artefacts can be worn so that they provide certain benefits and detriments. Artefacts are found scattered inside clusters of anomalies called "anomaly zones" or "anomaly fields". \n\nRemember:\n\n1. Wear anomaly detector attached to your belt.\n2. Use bolts to find a way through anomalies.\n3. Artefacts "jumps" inside anomaly field using some special pattern (way).\n4. From time to time anomalies creates artefacts, especially after blowout, so check each anomaly field you can find.</text>

		<text>About Pripyat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="time_magazine_about_npp">
		<text>For those who have seen it, Pripyat is a place of silence, devoid of life. The only movement that suggest human habitation is the flutter of laundry on clothes lines. But the laundry has been there, day and night, since April 27. On that day, most of the town's 40,000 citizens hastily collected a few belongings and piled into buses that evacuated them from the vicinity of the shattered Chernobyl nuclear reactor only half a mile away. They did not know then, and do not know now, whether they will return home in months or years. Or ever. On this and the following pages, TIME publishes the first photographs to appear in the U.S. of the ruined nuclear plant, the cleanup operation and the surrounding countryside.\nOne of the few Americans who have seen Pripyat is Dr. Robert Gale, a bone-marrow specialist who helped Soviet doctors cope with Chernobyl disaster, which so far has cost 26 lives. "It's a very dramatic thing to see a partially destroyed nuclear power plant." Gale told reporters after taking a helicopter tour of the scene. "The damage itself doesn't appear to be that great. A short distance away is a city of high rises that today is completely deserted. If you are looking down on it from a helicopter, it's not at all apparent why this is so. But one knows there is a silent enemy lurking there."\nThe enemy, of course, is radiation. There have been reports that some people, including looters, did not realize the danger. A Soviet newspaper disclosed that police sentries and, later, burglar alarms were used to protect Pripyat's abandoned dwellings. Beyond that, Soviet militia units and troops man watchtowers and checkpoints along a 60-mile perimeter. Despite the elaborate surveillance, two elderly women reportedly managed to hide in their Pripyat homes for more than a month after the accident. Eventually they were found and hospitalized. Their present condition is unknown.\nAll told, about 100 000 people from the Chernobyl vicinity will have to be monitored for the rest of their lives for signs of cancer. Among the most seriously injured were 300 plant workers and firemen, 24 of whom have already died. According to the Soviet press, there were other who took astonishing risks in the battle to control the seething reactor, including helicopter crews that dumped sand, lead and boron on the exposed reactor core in order to stop the massive leakage or radiation. For the long term, Moscow's plan is to enclose the unit in a concrete tomb equipped with a cooling system to dissipate heat generated by more than 150 tons of active nuclear fuel still in the reactor.\nIn the city of Kiev, 80 miles to the south, Soviet authorities are taking precautions against the spread of radiation into the water supply. Emergency wells are reportedly being dug to be used in the event that reservoirs fed by rivers become contaminated. Officials insist that radiation in the Dnieper River water has not exceeded the "permissible level," but they have urged citizens not to play soccer or volleyball on river beaches "because dust is kicked up."\nEver since the disaster, rumors have swirled throughout the country: that Chernobyl survivors could spread radiation like a contagious disease; that victims have been placed in lead coffins and buried in unusually deep graves; that vodka and red wine are effective antidotes to radiation. During a visit to Budapest, Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev told Hungarian factory workers, "Chernobyl has warned us once again; man has set in operation a really fantastic force that must be strictly controlled." It was a telling message that surely reverberated last week through the lifeless silence of Pripyat.\n\n*** Time Magazine, June 23, 1986 ***</text>

		<text>Hello!\n\nFirst of all, we'd like to thank you for taking part in our experiment. We're absolutely sure that the results would be significantly worse if it wasn't for you. Nevertheless, it's not the time to celebrate just yet: there's a long-term perspective of working - while it's still uncertain whether we'll be granted permission from the MOI/SSU.\n\nAs for your honorarium, 30 percent of it have already been transferred to a newly created offshore account. I do understand that the Bank of America is not the best way to keep "ill-gotten gains", however, there's actually nothing to worry about due to you, as far as I know, not living in the USA nor having any property at its soil.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to express our genuine hopes for your further participation in the experiment. You definitely know that there's a lot of benefits out venture has to offer - and I don't even mean the money...\nSincerely, the X-Ray Technologies science department. May 20, 1999</text>

		<text>Good day to you!\n\nYour request about providing a report on genetic sequences has been received, and our employees will soon prepare it for being sent to your department. However, considering what recently happened, we are urgently sending the main genetic sequence our subjects are being tested under:\nA-T-A G-A-A C-T-G C-A-C C-T-A C-A-T T-A-C\n\nI would also like to remind you that postal service can significantly slow down delivery time, thus, when it comes to situations demanding our department's instant reaction, it is way more reasonable to use the electronic mail service. Our department's current email address is: genetical@xraytechs.com. To send electronic letters, use the preinstalled software - Microsoft Outlook 98.\nSincerely, the X-Ray Technologies genetic research department head, S.E. Neumann. January 14, 1999</text>

		<text>Dear Alexey Vladimirovich,\n\nI've looked into the code samples you sent me. That's impressive... but are you sure all the possible emergency situations are covered? The most part of the code is ASM, however, there also are some C++ bits. May I get any documentation on these? As, you know, it's rather hard to read a code which you don't fully understand.\nWaiting for your response, the X-Ray Technologies IT department senior IT specialist, V.I. Andreev</text>

		<text>Hello pal!\n\nI've succeeded to acquire a NSA Intellipedia account from the heads, just as you wanted me to. I'm hoping there's no need to warn you, but still: DON'T DIG TOO DEEP! If they notice - and they will notice! - the account won't be the only thing wiped out, so you believe me. Alright, you should already know this anyway.\n\nThe login details are in our FTP's root folder. Any questions out there - email me. \n\nAnd yeah, I've also been told that they're about to start perform some magnetic field experiments in your lab. I mean, prepare for the folks popping in soon.\nSee you</text>
