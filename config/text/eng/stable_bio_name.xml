However, being deeply religious, he chose the Zone as an unconventional suicide method. Contrary to his expectations, he survived. He has gained invaluable experience and has won the respect of other stalkers thanks to his professional skills. Master is probably the most qualified mechanic in the Zone, and repairs equipment and vehicles. Installing security systems in gang bunkers is what he does best. He is welcome everywhere he goes. A simple, stern man, a bit rough at times.</text>

Came to the Zone out of curiosity, promising himself he would return home after two months. He never did. On his very first sally into the Zone, Sparrow managed to cross a field strewn with anomalies barehanded and clueless to how dangerous that was. As soon as he found out what he had done, he passed out. Since then, celebrates that date (October 9) as his second birthday.</text>

Ever since, Chezz claims this weapon to be a direct gift from the zone and believes he is alive to serve a great purpose. Furthermore, he believes his weapon to be an Artifact.

His parents decided not to evacuate, even though they lived within close proximity to the NPP.Alek's father was a renowned scientist and he wanted to study the noble gases released into the atmosphere and the effects it may have on the surrounding vegetation and wild life. Once the Chernobyl incident happened in 1986, the US government sent Alek's family to the Ukraine so his father could assist in studying the effects of the noble gases there.\n\n Alek grew up in harsh environments and the zone was a natural place for him to continue his father's work. Alek spends his days gathering data from local vegetation and wild life, he stays clear of most people and confers with scientists when he comes across interesting data. Alek has also been known to horde rare artifacts, especially ones that negate the effect of radiation poising. Alek wants to travel into the deepest areas of the zone where the radiation poisoning is highest, so he can get pure readings and he needs the rarest artifacts to get the job done.</text>
