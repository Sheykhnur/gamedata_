Realistically the problem isn't impossibility, but how to circumvent the laws of nature - a truth, but not an irreversible finality - to create wormholes. However, the research of the other laboratories have yielded "strange stones" with extraordinary properties that - if controlled and applied properly - makes teleportation and other such feats possible! I'm sure of it, even if it a wild theory in my head. I have to write down some diagrams and notes to demonstrate the concept...

K-4 batches has let rats take in the mutagen and evolve, surviving for well over a week before they died due to the "shriveling effect" on a living being's DNA. The results, although chaotic, has shown the many possibilities of genetic manipulation for medical and military application. At this rate, we might just move to human testing after a few more revisions to the K-X concoction.</text>

		<text>Transfer this to the research department\n\nI am informing you that the antenna (codename of BNA-01.4653.45) located in Limansk was altered under a facility which exerts a psychotropic effect (hereinafter - UPV-01.4653.45.01). This object had already been used to influence human mind back in the Soviet times, but the output power of the antenna is extremely low for our purposes. In this regard, the following changes were introduced:\n\n1. Powerful emergency generators and transformers were created right under the antenna in the basement (NKU-056);\n2. The line of emergency high-voltage wires goes directly to the station, for which we used segments of Pripyat Undergrounds' nodes.\n\nThe tests showed a good result in terms of psychotropic effects, however, I hasten to report on the negative aspects of this object: the installation was extremely unstable. Unfortunately, this facility has been allocated little funds (regardless of the antennas already available), configuration, materials, and the location of the antennas doesn't let them become the main ones. The temperature of the installation during operation quickly reaches critical; the recovery of operability occurs within 3-4 hours, which is too long: the device actually loses its meaning, and its use at such rates is a waste of energy and resources. Thus, the operation of UPV-01.4653.45.01 is planned to be only half the projected capacity.\n\nI'd also want to inform you that comrade N.A. Lebedev noticed Limansk has an extremely disadvantageous geographical position; however, we will rely on the fact that the Monolith fighters would suffice to deflect the possible threats in this sector.</text>

		<text>Pass this letter to the head of MOS-1, Petrov A.V.\n\nThe head of the third research group of the laboratory X-7, F.A. Gusev, is writing to you. To my great regret, me, my group and many other scientists in the scientific complex could not agree with comrade Lebedev. The reason for the big scandal are different approaches to studying the problem of the noosphere, and, as many have expressed, his ambitions are too irrational not to mention he suffers from superiority complex.\n\nAlmost all the scientists have agreed to preform a connection to the noosphere as soon as possible, but N.A. Lebedev was categorically opposed claiming that there is not enough power reserved at the moment and the experiment can get out of control with unpredictable consequences. He also responded extremely negatively and impulsively about the finished and approved calculations of the commission.\n\nIt is worth noting that for many years, major conflicts (including conflicts with senior officials) have occurred with him before. As an example, I can cite the case when Lebedev negatively spoke about the plan for constructing the main generators North to the Chernobyl NPP, and was against some experiments the purpose of which was any result at first, and its further study after that. Despite many successes, a valuable contribution to our development and other merits (a detailed explanation of the device number 62 principle), the central external group has decided to dismiss N.A. Lebedev and other members of his team.\n\nList of the dismissed (as of March 9, 2006):\n\nLebedev N.A.;\nFedotov A.A.;\nShilov B.N.;\nDrozdov A.V.;\nKalancha E.F. (at own request);\nSuslov V.I.

		<text>An urgent report to N.A. Fyodorov\n\n\nThe Kaymanov emitter is not functional from 9:00am to 9:30am - what kind of negligence is this?! More than a few times, I've said that the facility is able to be working for up to 72 hours: you only need to redistribute the energy coming from the generators according to my schematics. However, the emitter hasn't been functional for 30 minutes on each of the three last days, "to avoid overheating"! We cannot let anyone to cognize that: one of the our goals is protecting the plant from strangers - but there's a security breach at the moment, not that obvious but still critical. Thus, you'll have to eliminate any trace of the incident.\n\nI would also like to note that this situation may urge the Monolith people to get out of the control: their psyche is heavily unstable - and if it would be... well, I don't even want to think about what would happen. And don't you say that a 30-minute break is not a big problem! Caution is crucial in our venture.\nA.B. Vlasov</text>

		<text>The generators location plan. This document is to be passed to N.L. Ivanov\n\n\nIn this document, two possible plans of the main generators' location are described, and you will have to choose one because the research department employees' opinions have divided. The development went under the direction of G.R. Petrov and A.E. Kutsenko.\n\n\nThe first option.\n\nDesigned by: G.R. Petrov.\n\nLocation: 1600 meters to the North of ChNPP.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Presence of a huge area within which the construction can be conducted;\n2. A good opportunity of delivering building materials through the border of the nearest country;\n3. The chance of trespassing by strangers is reduced to zero: emitters will be built on the way to the plant, and we're planning to place the Monocrystal and the Monolith soldiers at the NPP itself;\n4. The soil is easy to process;\n5. Safety: in case of an emergency situation, the NPP itself would not be significantly damaged;\n6. Relatively small dimensions of the object - and, as a result, less materials to spend.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Huge energy costs of transferring energy: we will inevitably have to create a high-voltage powerline and several transformers of big sizes near the NPP;\n2. Building huge objects is energetically unprofitable;\n3. Small dimensions of the object - and, as a result, less power and, possibly, insufficient stability.\n\nFacility power: 60 000 units.\n\nEnergy costs: 500 000 units.\n\nCost price: 1 000 000 units.\n\nStability: 7/10.\n\nRatio of potential damage caused by the worst accident possible: 6 000.\n\n\nThe second option.\n\nDesigned by: A.E. Kutsenko.\n\nLocation: at the NPP itself.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Opportunity of building objects with high power consumption;\n2. Proximity to the power source compensates energy costs, thus creation of generators of bigger dimensions is possible;\n3. High stability;\n4. Direct surveillance ability;\n5. A formal excuse to remove the construction area from satellite maps;\n6. Building the generators in the shape of rectangle is more profitable energetically (rather than circle);\n7. No need to build a main signal sending antenna, calibration of which is extremely hard.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. High risk of harming the facility is case of an NPP assault;\n2. Hard to build;\n3. More building materials to spend.\n\nFacility power: 600 000 units.\n\nEnergy costs: 3 500 000 units.\n\nCost price: 9 000 000 units.\n\nStability: 9/10.\n\nRatio of potential damage caused by the worst accident possible: 180 000.\n\n\nAs you can see, the projects differ - and you are responsible for the final choice. Keep in mind that we currently wield all the needed funds and resources to stick to either of the plans.\nSincerely, N.A. Pavlov</text>

All candidates are promised to be liberated after the successful experiments outcome in exchange for their participation in these experiments. In case of an approval, all the official documents are issued, and the contract with obligations of the parties is signed.\n\nTherefore, the man who you are talking about could only be one of the subjects if they were life-imprisoned and have agreed to take part in the research.\n\nTo sort this situation out once and for all, we would need some additional information. Please, provide us as many record about your friend as possible: full name, job, age, profession, and so on.\n\nPersonally, I would like to express my hope that this situation - even if your assumption is right - won't interfere with our partnership.\nSincerely, the X-Ray Technologies legal department head, V.M.
