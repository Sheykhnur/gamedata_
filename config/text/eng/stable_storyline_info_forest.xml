        <text>Missing people are a common sight in the Zone... but you can look for them anyway: Seriy wants me to help search for his friend who hasn't been seen around in a long time.

		<text>Yeah, another shady task from Sidorovich: I need to check if there are any documents in the Forest's old mine and if there is, I'll have to bring it all to Petrenko who "will be pleased". It also looks like he's the one who's paying this time.</text>
