        <text>Shoot him, of course! Problem is getting in a good position and having the proper weapon. There is a AK in the green house, in the village up ahead. If you sneak by using junk as cover, you might be able to get a clean shot and down the bastard.</text>

        <text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_311131">
        <text>Bes is my name. I came to these parts three years ago. Like many of the guys in the Zone, I ain't got a pretty past - I'm a fugitive, wanted for two murders and GBH. A few years ago a friend of mine got battered pretty bad. They had to literally stitch him back together at the hospital. So I paid the bastards who did it a little "visit". When the coppers showed up, I had to shoot one of them and jump out of a third-floor window. I've been here since. I've done well in this place but the list of my crimes has got a little longer too. I try to fight the lawless just as I did on the outside. I train up rookies and teach them to survive in the Zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111311">
        <text>Don't you think you should join a faction if you want to fight crime - Duty or otherwise?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_31113111">
        <text>Duty fights against the Zone; Freedom for free access to the Zone. They're opposites that create friction and trouble for Loners that set their own morals and don't abide by clan rules. To me, as a stalker, I fight for the people - nothing else. Besides, certain elements of Duty are in cahoots with the government and Army. I don't want to wake up in a cold cell one day.</text>

    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_311141">
        <text>The Garbage. We are right at home here. You see the heaps of crap? You don't want to go there, trust me. So full of radioactive waste, the Geiger counters go off the scale. This is the only decent way into the Zone and bandits have been increasingly active here lately. They're shit scared of going deeper into the Zone, into Duty territory, like experienced stalkers. But those hyenas just love robbing the rookies here. So, if nobody else cares, we have to stand our ground and fight ourselves.</text>

    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_31114111">
        <text>Everywhere, and especially here, you gotta act like a human being, not like some greed-driven animal. That's my outlook on life.</text>

        <text>Are there any notable landmarks in the Garbage?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="gar_hellcar_start_3111411121">
        <text>We're at the abandoned cranes, a little further is a ruined building, then past that is where the junk piles start extending throughout the area. The main road should lead you to the hangar and vehicle graveyard, then the Duty checkpoint. Usually it's pretty quiet there since Duty are anti-mutant zealots. If worse comes to worse, you can spend the night in the hangar with Seriy's boys.</text>

        <text>Quick and dirty trouble with a side of heavy rad from the junk hills. Far better for rookies to stay in the Cordon and deal with the grunts, but since you're such an explorer, I'll tell you what I know. East of us is the vehicle scrapyard, with tons of filth and zombies waiting for a sucker to barge in. You probably already know about the Duty checkpoint up North that leads to the 100 Rads Bar. West is Agroprom, and further East past the scrapyard is the Dark Valley - place of death if you ask me. The Monolith and bandits control that area and weird stuff goes on there. That's all I know about these parts.</text>

        <text>Yeah, there's one problem... while I fended off the bandits here at the Garbage, my friend got lost. I want to go search for him, but there's almost no info. They say he and some other guy were sent to wipe out the zombies in some village. There is a lot of such villages in the Zone, but - as far as I understand - that village's either at the Warehouses or in the Forest. I'll search for him there.

        <text>Well, listen, everywhere you look it's a big stinking dump. After the accident in 1986, they brought radioactive waste, cranes, and all the destroyed machinery here. Basically, it's full of useless crap and a few anomalies here and there. You can even find some artifacts, but they're not spectacular so that's why you'll mostly find rookies in this place. Lots of rookies means lots of bandits, so it's best not to hang around too long. Go North and you'll eventually a Great Metal Factory and the 100 Rads Bar. Furthermore, to the East is the Dark Valley, a gloomy place. To the West is the Agroprom Research Institute. I'll mark safe pathways on your map.</text>

		<text>Good, right on time Major. We already know about the situation. Our military sources have confirmed that Sin's base is deep in the mines. Our strike team is ready to get rid of these bastards once and for all! We can't allow anyone to trifle with Duty! We are the strength, law, and order in this cesspool! I marked on your minimap the position where we will start our assault. Let's get to work! See you soon, Marked One.</text>
