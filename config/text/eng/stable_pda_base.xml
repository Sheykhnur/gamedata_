		<text>Bartering is very important in the Zone. During your tasks, you will meet many traders who will offer you various items to buy. Raising your "Barter" skill will help you get these items for lower prices.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_pda_skills_endurance_descr">
		<text>During your travel in the Zone, you will find many items which you might want to take with you to use or sell them. With raising your "Endurance" skill, you will gain more carry weight with each point spent transforming your backpack into a real trunk.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_pda_skills_sharpshooter_descr">
		<text>The Zone is a dangerous place: there are many well guarded areas which you might want to check out. You'll need to have a high "Sharpshooter" skill level to take out the guards from higher distances. The more it's raised, the less your hand will move during aiming - allowing you to shoot more and more accurately.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_pda_skills_survivor_descr">
		<text>Don't forget: you are a stalker! The Zone is not for kids, thus you'll need to raise the "Survivor" skill in order to stay alive. The more it's raised, the more hidden stash information you will get from dead stalkers; on top of that, your health will increase faster - therefore, it'll be much harder to die in firefights.</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="points_amount_descr">
		<text>Here you can see how many points you've collected so far. The amount of kills, completed tasks, NPC aids and exploration will give you extra points to spend on your skills. Remember to make wise decisions when spending your skill points: you cannot reset them after they are spent.</text>
