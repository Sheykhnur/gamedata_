		<text>My old pal Ghost contacted me and arranged a meeting at our Military Warehouses shelter. Perhaps he knows a way to restore my broken PDA.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="wipe_mercs_text">
		<text>Ghost told me there's a Merc squad at a nearby village; I should teach them a lesson and seize the "Crystal" artifact while I'm there. These bastards are not those who I'd be hesitant to kill for sure!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_contact_text">
		<text>According to the overheard Mercs' conversation, the artifact is currently held on their base located nearby. I need to meet the contact Ghost sent to me so we could work out a plan of action.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="artifact_quest_text">
		<text>Well, I've met the contact. We decided to attack the Merc base: I need it to find the artifact, while he just wants to avenge his comrades. The main thing is to find MadDog as he's most likely to be the one who's got the "Crystal".</text>

	<string id="meet_fang_text">
		<text>Another old pal of mine, Fang, invited me to the same Military Warehouses shelter. I might want to hurry up: there's a flashback about him not being the one who likes waiting...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_ghost_pripyat_text">
		<text>So, I met Fang who told me that I should head to Pripyat - that's where Ghost is hanging around at the moment. The town is accessible through Radar, which means I should visit those parts... yet again.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="crazy_text">
		<text>Some nut job wants me to recover the special shooter he lost at the abandoned village. He promises to reward me and it shouldn't be that hard to find it... but it looks very suspicious still.</text>
