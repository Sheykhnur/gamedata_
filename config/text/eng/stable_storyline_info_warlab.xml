	<string id="find_disel_generator_text">
		<text>Okay, I'm in the lab. First off, I need to find the primary generator's remote control and then try and shut it down. Huh, this is some familiar smell here...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="get_electricity_text">
		<text>Well, well, well... the power is out. I have to find a way to run the primary generator unless I want to admit all this shit was for nothing.</text>

	<string id="find_doors_switcher_text">
		<text>A door is blocking my way, and I need to open it somehow. Labs like this one are probably filled with various electronics, so I want to look for a switch or something.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="turn_off_lockdown_text">
		<text>Hmm, I found the switch but it doesn't let me... switch it. Perhaps I have to find some access card or security codes: the switch has a panel, and it seems like I can type digits on it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="find_enterance_text">
		<text>Damn it! The door is still closed. There's some panel fixed on the wall in front of the door, and it looks like I can type digits on it either. Do I have to search for another PC?..</text>
	</string>
	<string id="get_to_control_room_text">
		<text>Oh, the path is finally clear. To get this showdown dealt with I need to get to the main control room, enter the override codes into something and then... shut the bloody Generators down. I wonder what's up with Ghost at the moment...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="deactivate_generators_text">
		<text>So is this it? The room is a straight shot to. I need to enter the codes, and then - all or nothing.</text>
