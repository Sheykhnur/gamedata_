		<text>It's a real tragedy: during the test this morning, the emissions that shouldn't have made it into the lab somehow passed through. The test subjects outside were turned into violent, brainless monsters; inside, the emissions were so strong that some had their brains explode! “Brain Scorcher” - that's how this place really should be called. Lucky for us, I got to the failsafe before everyone died... yet there were some casualties: Professor Kalancha hasn't survived. What an awful news...\n\nA restoration is currently in progress down here, and I'm hoping that the government would think about shutting the labs and experiments down. Howbeit, I'm not staying here like a headless chicken for any more!</text>

		<text>Tomorrow is the big day: after years of work, our complex is finally ready for a test run. Kalancha seems confident everything will check out; even Lebedev from X-2 came to visit - and I thought he'd have far more important things to do...\n\nAfter testing failsafe mechanisms yet again, they are indeed robust. Even if things go wrong, we'll have a way to cut the emissions shortly... but I'm hoping it won't be necessary.</text>
