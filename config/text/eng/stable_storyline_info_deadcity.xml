		<text>So, I'm here, at Dead City. I need to find the Mercs den, show my pass to the guard and grab the package - and try not to stay there for long.</text>

	<string id="meet_informer_text">
		<text>That's quite a place the Mercs got here! Looks like the building is a former school... but whatever. Now I should find the local boss, take the package and get the hell out of this place.</text>

	<string id="find_your_stuff_text">
		<text>Not only the assholes knocked me out but also robbed me blind... however, all of them are in a better place now. As for me, I need to find something they put my stuff into - probably some box or a bag.</text>
