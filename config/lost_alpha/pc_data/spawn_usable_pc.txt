for monitor you should add logic:

[logic]
active = ph_computer

[ph_computer]
availability = accessible
pc_type = desktop
icons_alignment = vertical
wallpaper = wallpaper3
show_tips = true
...

OK SO:

availability can be: accessible, malfunction, locked

- locked will display info that this pc is locked
is controlled by infoportion so we can use it and thus make sure that user won't use it before he finds infoportion

- malfunction - will display that pc is bsoded 

- accessible means that you can use it



pc_type:

- desktop
- laptop (not finished)

----------------------
NOT NECESSARY BUT FUN:

user_name = xxx just a name to display, like in fallout when you started pc and you could see 'logged as 'fuck you''

password - password to unlock pc, useless if availability is accessible or malfunction, used only for locked availability

password_info - infoportion name, will be given when you type password (that was just to prevent situation when you have to type password everytime you use pc)

----------------------

icons_alignment = "horizontal" or "vertical" or "mess"

wallpaper = wallpaper1, wallpaper2, ..., wallpaper7

other wallpapers: wallpaper_iaea (atomic sign), wallpaper_water, wallpaper_dso (un military police sign as on niva)


show_tips = true or false - whether show text tips when you target monitor with your crosshair ...text like: turn on/off pc (if availability is available), this pc is not operational (malfunction) or you can't use this pc now (locked)

----------------------
GAMES:

tetris = true or false - whether pc should contain tetris game
puzzle - true or false - whether pc should contain puzzle game
solitare = true or false - whether pc should contain solit. game
----------------------

known_info = comma-separated list with text files (those are actually section names from config\lost_alpha\pc_data\pc_data.ltx)

known_image = test_pc_known_image_001, test_pc_known_image_002 (etc)

known_code =
known_audio =
known_video =
known_hex = X where X=number 1-5, so  this just a number of random files with some hex dump in it which will be added to the pc
